# Hangman

Hangeman is a very popular word guessing game, where a player gets limited number of guesses to guess the word.
Each time the player guesses a wrong letter, the hangman display grows. Eventually when all lives are lost the display shows a hanged man, hence the name.

## Design

### Colour  

I have used the default background of the terminal which is black. To highlight certain text on the command line I have changed the text colour for easier readibility.  
 

### Font  

I have used the default font here. I have used ascii art to display the game logo and winner and looser graphics.  


## Features  

1. A player has multiple options to choose from.  
2. Immadiate game start, in the default mode which is level medium.  
3. 3 levels of difficulty to choose from.  
4. Simple explanation on the game in the rules section.  
5. Attractive graphics using ascii art.

### Packages  

1. json - Used this package to read the data from json file where words are stored.  
2. random - Used this package to pick a random word from the dictionary of words.  


## Testing  

I have tested the code and the game logic by  

* Passing the python code through the PEP8 validator (http://pep8online.com/) and solving any errors and warnings.  
* Passing invalid and valid values while playing the game to check if the program responds as expected.  
* Tested the game in gitpod terminal as well as heroku terminal.
