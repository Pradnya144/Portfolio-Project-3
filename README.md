# Hangman

Hangeman is a very popular word guessing game, where a player gets limited number of guesses to guess the word.
Each time the player guesses a wrong letter, the hangman display grows. Eventually when all lives are lost the display shows a hanged man, hence the name.

## Design

### Colour  

I have used the default background of the terminal which is black. To highlight certain text on the command line I have changed the text colour for easier readibility.
